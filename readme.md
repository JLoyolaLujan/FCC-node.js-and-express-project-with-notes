# FCC Node.js and Express course 

### this is a space for all the notes I've taken

[This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hpc70_OoAg&t=82s&ab_channel=freeCodeCampEspa%C3%B1ol) is a masterpiece. It took me a 
few days to finish but it helped me a lot to understand a LOT
of things about Node.js/Express. 

_The video is in spanish, all notes are in english._

There might be a few mistakes here and there (in the notes), but 
everything went smoothly as I was following each example. 

This repository, besides multiple files with notes, also contains
two projects. The first one I did it by following the video, the second
attempt was just me trying to follow my own notes. The later is the 
"complete and clean" version of the first one.

I had a lot of fun while doing this. Muchas gracias FreeCodeCamp!
